OR by supplying a list of specific filenames.

## unpack\_NEXRAD\_binary.R

utilizing system commands, decompress nexrad data (if compressed) and
export to netCDF file format utilizing java blob from UCAR.

## merge\_NEXRAD\_moments\_v2.0.R

extract data from netCDF arrays, melt into data frames and merge nexrad
resolution cells by azimuth, range, elevation, and time. Additionally,
calculate Z from dBZ for use in calculating biological reflectivity, per
Chilson.
