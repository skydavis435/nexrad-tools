## Installation

You can install the development version of this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("skydavis435/nexrad-tools")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=F}
library(nexrad.tools)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

# nexrad-tools
A compilation of scripts used to download NEXRAD data from AWS, unpack, read, and generate simple plots. 

# aws_download_NEXRAD.R & aws_download_NEXRAD.R
Grab nexrad binary files from AWS by supplying a station and date range OR by supplying a list of specific filenames. 

# unpack_NEXRAD_binary.R
utilizing system commands, decompress nexrad data (if compressed) and export to netCDF file format utilizing java blob from UCAR. 

# merge_NEXRAD_moments_v2.0.R
extract data from netCDF arrays, melt into data frames and merge nexrad resolution cells by azimuth, range, elevation, and time. Additionally, calculate Z from dBZ for use in calculating biological reflectivity, per Chilson.
